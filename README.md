RocketBot is an AWS Lambda function that acts as a bridge between [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com), allowing you to trigger a Buildkite build from a comment on a pull request on GitHub. For more information about RocketBot, its features, and how to use the tool, see the [docs](docs/) folder.
