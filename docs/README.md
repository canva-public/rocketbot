# About RocketBot

RocketBot is an AWS Lambda function that acts as a bridge between [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com), allowing you to trigger a Buildkite build from a comment on a pull request on GitHub. RocketBot is invoked by GitHub webhooks (on opening a PR, commenting on a PR, leaving PR review comments, and so on). Use RocketBot comments to run various predefined builds for your PR.

For information about RocketBot, the RocketBot builds available for your PR, and how to run RocketBot builds, see [Getting started](getting-started.md).
